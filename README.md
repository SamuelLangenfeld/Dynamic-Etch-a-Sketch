# Dynamic-Etch-a-Sketch

This is the Odin Project Etch A Sketch http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/javascript-and-jquery

I created this project to learn javascript and jquery. The project uses buttons, a prompt, mouseenter, and keydown functions. The basic concept is that I created a table and based on user input I change the style of the table data to different background colors. I also parsed the string of the color code to enable the program to darken the existing background colors.
